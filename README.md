# Cuisine_Prediction_Classifier

In machine learning, a multiclass or multinomial classification is the problem of classifying instances into one of three or more classes called labels. While many classification algorithms, naturally permit the use of more than two classes, some are by nature binary algorithms; these can, however, be turned into multinomial classifiers by a variety of strategies.
The availability of various methodologies and techniques like Xgboost, Na√Øve Bayes classifier, SVM,  and Random Forest classification algorithms in order to implement a successful working model. 
A successful working of multiclass classifier model can be useful in machine learning fields which require the need to be correctly classified without any human intervention. 
The outcome of this project was to develop a successfully working classification model which is able to correctly and accurately classify the input parameter into the correct output labels.
The goal of developing a predictive model is to develop a model that is accurate on unseen data.
This can be achieved using statistical techniques where the training dataset is carefully used to estimate the performance of the model on new and unseen data.
In this project we will evaluate the performance of our gradient boosting models with XGBoost in Python.
