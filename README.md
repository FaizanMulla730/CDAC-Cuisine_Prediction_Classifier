# Worked in the development of AI and ML models bringing automation and further development in existing ML models. 

## Implementation of a Multiclass Classification Model to determine which category the ingredients of a given cuisine match. There are 20 such labels describing the cuisine is whether Indian, Italian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Mexican etc.


The Dataset passed over the model is a balanced one, so that no label category gets an output prediction advantage over the others. The Output of the Model is the Class to which the cuisine belongs, on passing the input string of ingredients. The model gives close to a 95% accuracy score, which proves to be a good one as the dataset fed to the model is a massive one.
